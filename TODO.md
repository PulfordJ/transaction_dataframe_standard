Tether requirements.txt to a specific Pandas? same with other dependencies.
- For columns "Money In" and "Money Out" perhaps we should use 0 instead of NaN.
- How would this standard handle investment accounts, e.g buying/selling a fund/stocks? Should it?
- Could an adapter be made for the open api?
- Needs a versions file to make dependencies static
- Needs a versioning system 
- Release system 
- linting/autoformatting
- CI (with/ auto release?

Perpetual TODOs:
- More adapters to support more banks.
- More functions to support more processing of the standardised data!
